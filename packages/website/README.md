# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!**

If you are not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

It will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) into your project so that you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so that you can tweak them. At this point, you are on your own.

You do not have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you should not feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool would not be useful if you can not customize it when you are ready for it.
