## Patent and Payment Notice

This software includes technology protected by US Patent Nos. 11694197 and 11188911. Using this patented technology, which forms a core part of the software’s functionality, requires payment through the software’s built-in cryptocurrency mechanism. The payment amount is determined automatically by the software, and the cryptocurrency used (e.g., BTC, LTC, DOGE) depends on the blockchain you select. For detailed payment instructions, please refer to the software's documentation.

You may modify the software freely under the MIT License, but any use of the patented functionality, including in modified versions, requires compliance with these payment terms or obtaining an alternative license. Bypassing the payment mechanism while still using the patented technology may constitute patent infringement. For alternative licensing options, please contact clemens@bitcoincomputer.io.
