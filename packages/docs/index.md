# Introduction

_The Bitcoin Computer is a Turing-complete metaprotocol for UTXO-based blockchains. You can build of games, social networks, tokens, decentralized exchanges, enterprise applications and much more._

**Free Computation.** Execution costs are fixed and independent of the number of computational steps of a smart contract.

**Metaprotocol.** There is no trusted intermediaries and no extra blockchain or token. It works just like Ordinals or Runes, just that it's Turing complete, meaning that you can build applications that are as decentralized and secure as the underlying blockchain is.

**Multicoin**. We supports Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Pepecoin, with Bitcoin Cash support coming soon. You can launch into all of these communities simultaneously because the same code works across all of these chains.

**JavaScript.** Smart contracts are written in JavaScript or TypeScript, leveraging vast ecosystems and enabling seamless integration with web applications.

**Data Ownership.** An on-chain object is stored in a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) and can only be updated by spending the UTXO. Thus the owner of the UTXO is the owner of the data and data ownership is as secure as cryptocurrency ownership.

**Compatible.** You can build application that use assets from other protocols - for example a game with ordinals or a DEX for Runes. Other protocols like BitVM are orthogonal and can be "plugged in" to enforce complex data ownership conditions.

**Simple.** To deploy a smart contract, inscribe a JavaScript class, to create an on-chain object, inscribe a constructor call and to update an on-chain object, inscribe a function call.

**Fast**. Built-in optimizations avoid any redundant computation. Apps are fast out of the box.

**History.** As every state update is recorded in a transaction, each historical state is recoverable. Additionally, all updates are timestamped and digitally signed, making it easy to audit applications.

**Privacy.** On-chain objects are public by default, but the protocol has support for end-to-end encryption and off-chain data storage. This enables CCPA and GDPR compliant enterprise applications.
