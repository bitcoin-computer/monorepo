# Bitcoin Computer

### A Turing-complete Metaprotocol for UTXO-based Blockchains

_The Bitcoin computer is a protocol for building applications that are as secure and decentralized as Bitcoin is. You can build games, tokens, exchanges and more without relying on a sidechain, an extra token, or a trusted third party._

**Free Computation** - Smart contracts are executed on the client. Execution costs are fixed and independent of the number of computational steps.

**Multicoin**. Deploy on Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Pepecoin (Bitcoin Cash coming soon) using the same code.

**JavaScript & Typescript** - Build decentralized applications that integrate seamlessly into web applications using your favorite tools and execute on high performance Javascript engines.

**Simple** - Deploy a smart contract by inscribing a JavaScript class, create an on-chain object by inscribing a constructor call and update an on-chain object by inscribing a function call.

**Fast** - Built-in optimizations eliminate redundant computation, ensuring high-performance applications out of the box.

**History** - Every historical state is recoverable. Each update is stored in a timestamped, digitally signed transaction.

**Data Ownership** - On-chain objects are stored in UTXOs, meaning only the UTXO owner can modify the data. This ensures data ownership is as secure as cryptocurrency ownership.

**Compatible** - Compatible with existing Bitcoin protocols. Build apps for Ordinals, Runes, or even integrate with BitVM to enforce complex data ownership rules.

**Privacy** - Public by default, but supports encryption and off-chain storage for CCPA- and GDPR-compliant applications.
